## General Introduction

Every day many people pass through Lucerne train station and several simulation programs were implemented to study the interaction between geometry of the building and the passenger's flow. With the emergence of free newspapers, this problem got new dimensions: If the ordinary commuter is heading towards the newspapers box he has to cross the normal flow. Therefore we want to investigate how the position of the box effects the velocity and social flow.
We intend to use the layout of an existing situation to find the ideal arrangement of the newspaper box(es) by manipulating its location.


(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)


## The Model

We intend to use the Social Force Model. Our independent variable is the position of a newspaper box. The dependent variable is the time a person needs on average to get through the bottle neck. In addition, the other initial parameters like number of people, rate of paper-taker, velocity of the pedestrians, and so on.

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

In order to answer our question we will compare two distinguishingly different positions. How do we select these positions? We will choose several different positions, run the simulations and then visually evaluate the two most diverse options.
we will run the whole simulations for the two remaining situations and evaluate the time per person for a given distance.
The output is how strong the influence of a bad placement could be.


(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )



## Expected Results
We expect to get both a significant and a relevant difference between the options.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
